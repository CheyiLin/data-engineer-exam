# Data Engineer Exam

## 1. Anomaly Detecton

You have 67 time series data, please add a columns call "anomaly".

Fill 1 if the point is anomaly else 0, you can use *any* method to detect anomaly.

( P.S. The time series data may contain 0 anomaly. )

## 2. Pandas

Please use *pandas* transform *need_aggregate.csv* from Figure 1 to Figure 2.

+ Figure 1

## 3. Deep Learning

Use one of framework (*TensorFlow*/*PyTorch*/*Keras*) to build an LSTM Model, train and predict the file you produce on step 2. Please point out which time point is an anomaly.
